## What is Augments?
Augments is a classic text-based role-playing game, with a few enhancements (just like the kind you'll find in the plot ;))
In Augments, you play the role of a happy traveler on a walk through the calm autumn woods -- calm on the surface, at any rate. 

You'll soon become embroiled in a mechanical mystery, diving deeper into the unknown wonders of the woods as you attempt to uncover the curiosities which lie within. You may find danger and you may find the future -- but you're always guaranteed to find change, asked for or not!

Augments was built to emulate a terminal environment, to enhance the feeling of nostalgia from the age of classic role-playing games, with the additional goal of keeping the focus on the story, rather than the gameplay. 

To make things a bit more visual for a modern audience, buttons are generally used instead of keystrokes, and images are scattered throughout as aids to the plot.

Please enjoy!

## How do you play?
Everything you need to play this game is within this repo. It is non-compiled javascript, so no preparations are necessary -- once you have the files, load up the base directory in your browser and you're good to go!

I'm also currently hosting the game at http://mberlove.com/proj/game-off-2016/.

Gameplay itself is straightfoward -- press `ENTER` to start, then at each decision point, click the button that corresponds to the choice you want to make, and watch the plot unfold. There are no checkpoints, so think carefully! And remember that the fun is in exploring.

- The base CSS to emulate the look of a shell terminal came from [this useful site](http://www.codechewing.com/library/mac-terminal-shell-css-html/), with some modifications.
- The [CYO Game Engine](https://github.com/danielstern/cyo), a javascript library for generating role-playing games, was used to handle the interaction and flow. It was extremely straighforward to use and expand upon.
